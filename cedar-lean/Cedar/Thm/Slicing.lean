This file defines what it means for a policy slice to be sound.

We prove two main theorems:

* Authorization returns the same response for a sound policy slice as for the
  original collection of policies (`isAuthorized_eq_for_sound_policy_slice`).
* It is sound to slice policies based on scope constraints (see
  `isAuthorized_eq_for_scope_based_policy_slice`). The proof is based on a more
  general lemma (`sound_bound_analysis_produces_sound_slices`) that covers all
  forms of slicing that are based on identifying "bound" principal and resource
  entities (if any) for a policy, such that the policy evaluates to true on an
  input only if the request principal and resource are descendents of the
  corresponding bound entities. Currently, we are extracting bounds only from
  the scope constraints. The general lemma also covers more sophisticated
  analyses that can extract bounds from policy conditions as well.
