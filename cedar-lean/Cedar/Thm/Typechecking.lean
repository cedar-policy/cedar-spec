  then .ok ty
  else .error (.unexpectedType ty)

If typechecking succeeds, then for any request consistent with the schema,
either (1) evaluation produces a boolean or (2) it returns an error of type
`entityDoesNotExist`, `extensionError`, or `arithBoundsError`. Both options are
encoded in the `EvaluatesTo` predicate. The type checker cannot protect against
these errors because it has no knowledge of the entities/context that will be
provided at authorization time, and it does not reason about the semantics of
arithmetic operators.
