This file contains the top-level correctness properties for the Cedar validator.
We show that if validation succeeds for a set of policies, then for any request
consistent with the schema, evaluating a policy in this set either produces a
boolean value, or throws one of the errors in the set of valid errors.

/--
If a set of policies is well-typed (valid) with respect to the schema according to the validator,
and the input request and entities are consistent with the schema, then evaluating a policy in this set
either produces a boolean value, or throws an error of type `entityDoesNotExist`, `extensionError`, or
`arithBoundsError`. These errors cannot be protected against at validation time, as they depend on runtime
information.
