/--
Forbid trumps permit: if a `forbid` policy is satisfied, the request is denied.
-/
theorem forbid_trumps_permit
  (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) :
  (∃ (policy : Policy),
    policy ∈ policies ∧
    policy.effect = .forbid ∧
    satisfied policy request entities) →
  (isAuthorized request entities policies).decision = .deny
:= by
  intro h
  unfold isAuthorized
  simp [if_satisfied_then_satisfiedPolicies_non_empty h]

/--
A request is explicitly permitted when there is at least one satisfied permit policy.
-/
def IsExplicitlyPermitted (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) : Prop :=
  ∃ (policy : Policy),
    policy ∈ policies ∧
    policy.effect = .permit ∧
    satisfied policy request entities

/-- A request is allowed only if it is explicitly permitted. -/
theorem allowed_if_explicitly_permitted (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) :
  (isAuthorized request entities policies).decision = .allow →
  IsExplicitlyPermitted request entities policies
:= by
  unfold isAuthorized
  generalize (satisfiedPolicies .forbid policies request entities) = forbids
  generalize hp : (satisfiedPolicies .permit policies request entities) = permits

  cases h₁ : permits.isEmpty <;> simp

/--
Default deny: if not explicitly permitted, the request is denied.
This is contrapositive of allowed_if_explicitly_permitted.
-/
theorem default_deny (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) :
  ¬ IsExplicitlyPermitted request entities policies →
  (isAuthorized request entities policies).decision = .deny
:= by
  intro h₀
  generalize h₁ : (isAuthorized request entities policies).decision = dec
  by_contra h₂
  cases dec
  case allow =>
    have h₃ := allowed_if_explicitly_permitted request entities policies h₁
    contradiction
  case deny => contradiction

/--
Order and duplicate independence: isAuthorized produces the same result
regardless of policy order or duplicates.
-/
theorem order_and_dup_independent (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies₁ policies₂ : Policies) :
  policies₁ ≡ policies₂ →
  isAuthorized request entities policies₁ = isAuthorized request entities policies₂
:= by
  intro h
  have hf := satisfiedPolicies_order_and_dup_independent .forbid request entities h
  have hp := satisfiedPolicies_order_and_dup_independent .permit request entities h
  have he := errorPolicies_order_and_dup_independent request entities h
