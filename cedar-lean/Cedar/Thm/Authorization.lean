/--
Forbid trumps permit: if a `forbid` policy is satisfied, the request is denied.
-/
theorem forbid_trumps_permit
  (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) :
  (∃ (policy : Policy),
    policy ∈ policies ∧
    policy.effect = forbid ∧
    satisfied policy request entities) →
  (isAuthorized request entities policies).decision = deny

  intro h

/--
A request is explicitly permitted when there is at least one satisfied permit policy.
-/
def IsExplicitlyPermitted (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) : Prop :=
  ∃ (policy : Policy),
    policy ∈ policies ∧
    policy.effect = permit ∧

/-- A request is allowed only if it is explicitly permitted. -/

/--
Default deny: if not explicitly permitted, the request is denied.
This is contrapositive of allowed_if_explicitly_permitted.
-/
theorem default_deny (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) :
  ¬ IsExplicitlyPermitted request entities policies →
  (isAuthorized request entities policies).decision = deny

/--
Order and duplicate independence: isAuthorized produces the same result
regardless of policy order or duplicates.
-/
theorem order_and_dup_independent (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies₁ policies₂ : Policies) :
  policies₁ ≡ policies₂ →
  isAuthorized request entities policies₁ = isAuthorized request entities policies₂
