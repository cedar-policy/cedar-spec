This file contains `simp` lemmas for proofs about code that uses the `do`
notation together with `Except` and `Option`.

-- The `Except.bind_*` theorems let `simp` reduce terms that use the `do` notation.
@[simp] theorem Except.bind_ok_T (a : α) (f : α → ExceptT ε Id β) :
  (bind (Except.ok a) f : ExceptT ε Id β) = f a
:= by rfl

@[simp] theorem Except.bind_ok (a : α) (f : α → Except ε β) :
  (bind (Except.ok a) f : Except ε β) = f a
:= by rfl

@[simp] theorem Except.bind_err (e : ε) (f : α → Except ε β) :
  (bind (Except.error e) f : Except ε β) = (Except.error e)
:= by rfl

-- The `Option.bind_*` theorems let `simp` reduce terms that use the `do` notation.
@[simp] theorem Option.bind_some_T (a : α) (f : α → OptionT Id β) :
  (bind (Option.some a) f : OptionT Id β) = f a
:= by rfl

@[simp] theorem Option.bind_some_fun (a : α) (f : α → Option β) :
  (bind (Option.some a) f : Option β) = f a

theorem do_error {res : Except ε α} {e : ε} {f : α → β} :
  (do let v ← res ; .ok (f v)) = .error e ↔

:= by cases res <;> simp

theorem do_ok {res : Except ε α} {f : α → β} :
