This file contains `verify*` functions that use the Cedar symbolic evaluator,
authorizer, and hierarchy enforcer to generate a list of `Asserts`. These are
boolean terms whose conjunction is unsatisfiable if and only if the verified
property holds.

abbrev Asserts := List Term

/--
Returns asserts that are unsatisfiable iff the evaluation of `p`, represented as
a Term of type .option .bool, satisfies `φ` on all inputs drawn from `εnv`.  See also
`verifyNeverErrors`.
-/
def verifyEvaluate (φ : Term → Term) (p : Policy) (εnv : SymEnv) : Result Asserts := do
  let x := p.toExpr
  let t ← compile x εnv
  (enforce [x] εnv).elts ++ [not (φ t)]

/--
Returns asserts that are unsatisfiable iff the authorization decisions produced
by `ps₁` and `ps₂`, represented as Terms of type .bool, satisfy `φ` on all
inputs drawn from `εnv`. See also `verifyAlwaysAllows`, `verifyAlwaysDenies`,
`verifyImplies`, `verifyEquivalent`, and `verifyDisjoint`.

def verifyIsAuthorized (φ : Term → Term → Term) (ps₁ ps₂ : Policies) (εnv : SymEnv) : Result Asserts := do
  let t₁ ← isAuthorized ps₁ εnv
  let t₂ ← isAuthorized ps₂ εnv
  let xs := (ps₁ ++ ps₂).map Policy.toExpr
  (enforce xs εnv).elts ++ [not (φ t₁ t₂)]

/--
Returns asserts that are unsatisfiable iff `p` does not error on any input in
`εnv`. If the asserts are satisfiable, then there is some input in `εnv` on
which `p` errors.
-/
def verifyNeverErrors (p : Policy) (εnv : SymEnv) : Result Asserts :=
  verifyEvaluate isSome p εnv

/--
Returns asserts that are unsatisfiable iff the authorization decision of `ps₁`
implies that of `ps₂` for every input in `εnv`. In other words, every input
allowed by `ps₁` is allowed by `ps₂`.
-/
def verifyImplies (ps₁ ps₂ : Policies) (εnv : SymEnv) : Result Asserts :=
  verifyIsAuthorized implies ps₁ ps₂ εnv

/--
Returns asserts that are unsatisfiable iff `ps` allows all inputs in `εnv`.
-/
def verifyAlwaysAllows (ps : Policies) (εnv : SymEnv) : Result Asserts := do
  verifyImplies [allowAll] ps εnv
where
  allowAll : Policy := {
    id             := "allowAll",
    effect         := .permit,
    principalScope := .principalScope .any,
    actionScope    := .actionScope .any,

/--
Returns asserts that are unsatisfiable iff `ps` denies all inputs in `εnv`.
-/
def verifyAlwaysDenies (ps : Policies) (εnv : SymEnv) : Result Asserts := do
  verifyImplies ps [] εnv

/--
Returns asserts that are unsatisfiable iff `ps₁` and `ps₂` produce the same
authorization decision on all inputs in `εnv`.
-/
def verifyEquivalent (ps₁ ps₂ : Policies) (εnv : SymEnv) : Result Asserts :=
  verifyIsAuthorized eq ps₁ ps₂ εnv

/--
Returns asserts that are unsatisfiable iff there is no input in `εnv` that is
allowed by both `ps₁` and `ps₂`.  This checks that the authorization semantics
of `ps₁` and `ps₂` are disjoint. If this query is satisfiable, then there is at
least one input that is allowed by both `ps₁` and `ps₂`.

def verifyDisjoint (ps₁ ps₂ : Policies) (εnv : SymEnv) : Result Asserts :=
  verifyIsAuthorized disjoint ps₁ ps₂ εnv
where
  disjoint (t₁ t₂ : Term) := not (and t₁ t₂)
