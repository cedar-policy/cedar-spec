This file defines the algorithm for emitting well-formedness assumptions about
Cedar hierarchies. A valid Cedar hierarchy graph is the irreflexive transitive
closure of a DAG.  (Note that the `in` operator is reflexive, but this is
enforced separately by the semantics, and it's not needed in the hierarchy.)

The generated assumptions are expressed as Terms that enforce the acyclicty and
transitivity constraints on the symbolic store, for a given Cedar expression.

The grounding relies on the fact that a Cedar expression can reference only a
finite number of entities (so the domain of the quantification is finite), and
we can compute an overapproximation of that set by statically analyzing the
expression. We call this set the _footprint_ of the expression `x`, and it
consists of all subexpressions of `x` that could have an Entity type. The
grounding procedure computes the footprint, and grounds the acyclicity and
transitivity constraints on the set of entity terms in the footprint.

/-
Returns the terms corresponding to subexpressions of `x` of the following form:

  * A variable term with an entity type
  * An entity reference literal
  * An attribute access expression with an entity type
  * A binary (`getTag`) expression with an entity type

These are the only basic expressions in Cedar that may evaluate to an entity.
All other expressions that evaluate to an entity are build up from the above
basic expresions.

All returned terms are of type `TermType.option .entity`.
