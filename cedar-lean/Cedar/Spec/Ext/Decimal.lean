A decimal number consists of an integer part and a fractional part.
The former is the integer number before the decimal point.
The latter is the decimal number minus its integer part.
For instance, 10.234 is a decimal number. Its integer part is 10 and its fractional part is 0.234
We restrict the number of the digits after the decimal point to 4.
