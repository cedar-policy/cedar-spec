Given a type environment `Γ`, returns a symbolic environment `εnv` that
represents all concrete inputs (requests and entities) `env ∈ εnv` that conform
to `Γ` according to `Cedar.Validation.requestMatchesEnvironment` and
`Cedar.Validation.entitiesMatchEnvironment`.

The Cedar symbolic compiler assumes that it receives well-typed policies.  This
function enforces this requirement by calling Cedar's typechecker. Specifically,
given a policy `p` and type environment `Γ`, this function calls the Cedar
typechecker to obtain a policy `p'` that is semantically equivalent to `p` and
well-typed with respect to `Γ`.

All functions defined in this file that accept policies as input _must_ be
called on the _output_ of this function (or `wellTypedPolicies`) to ensure that
symbolic compilation succeeds. Applying the symbolic compiler directly to a
policy `p` may result in type errors---that is, the compiler rejecting the
policy because it does not satisfy the `WellTyped` constraints that are assumed
by the compiler, and enforced by the typechecker through policy transformation.

The Cedar symbolic compiler assumes that it receives well-typed policies.  This
function enforces this requirement by calling Cedar's typechecker. Specifically,
given policies `ps` and a type environment `Γ`, this function calls the Cedar
typechecker on each `p ∈ ps` to obtain a policy `p'` that is semantically
equivalent to `p` and well-typed with respect to `Γ`.

All functions defined in this file that accept policies as input _must_ be
called on the _output_ of this function (or `wellTypedPolicy`) to ensure that
symbolic compilation succeeds. Applying the symbolic compiler directly to
policies `ps` may result in type errors---that is, the compiler rejecting the
policies because they don't satisfy the `WellTyped` constraints that are assumed
by the compiler, and enforced by the typechecker through policy transformation.

Given a verification condition generator `vc` and a symbolic environment `εnv`,
calls the SMT solver (if necessary) on an SMTLib encoding of `vc εnv` and
returns `none` if the result is unsatisfiable. Otherwise returns `some I`
containing a counterexample interpretation `I`. The function `vc` is expected to
produce a list of terms type .bool that are well-formed with respect to `εnv`
according to `Cedar.SymCC.Term.WellFormed`. This call resets the solver.

Given policies `ps`, a verification condition generator `vc`, and a symbolic
environment `εnv`, calls the SMT solver (if necessary) on an SMTLib encoding of
`vc εnv` and returns `none` if the result is unsatisfiable. Otherwise
returns `some env` containing a counterexample environment such that
evaluating `ps` in `env` violates the property verified by `vc`.

The function `vc` is expected to produce a list of terms type .bool that are
well-formed with respect to `εnv` according to `Cedar.SymCC.Term.WellFormed`.
These terms must encode a property of policies `pc`.  Specifically, for each
term `t ∈ vc εnv`, there must be a set of expressions `xs` such that each
`x ∈ xs` is a subexpression of `p ∈ ps`, and the meaning of `t` is a function of
the meaning of `xs`.  This ensures that findings generated by `solve` are sound
and complete.

This call resets the solver.

Returns `none` iff the authorization decision of `ps₁` implies that of `ps₂` for
every well-formed input in `εnv`. That is, every input allowed by `ps₁` is
allowed by `ps₂`; `ps₂` is either more permissive than, or equivalent to, `ps₁`.

Returns `none` iff there is no well-formed input in `εnv` that is allowed by
