# Some fuzz targets expect that an initial corpus will be present when they
# start running. This is important for unstructured fuzzing because it's not
# reasonable to expect that we will find many, if any, valid policies by
# randomly generating bytes (even with coverage guidance).
#
# This script exits cleanly if it doesn't need initialize a corpus, so it's safe
# to run this for all fuzz targets in automation.
