# Cedar DRT

This folder contains code for fuzzing, property-based testing, and differential testing of Cedar.
See the README in the toplevel directory `..` for instructions on how to run.

## Available fuzz targets

The table below lists all available fuzz targets, including which component of the code they test and whether they perform property-based testing of the Rust code (PBT) or differential testing of the Rust code against the Dafny spec (DRT).

| Name | Component(s) tested | Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [`abac-type-directed`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/abac-type-directed.rs) | Evaluator | DRT | Diff test evaluator on ABAC policies using (mostly) well-typed inputs |
| [`abac`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/abac.rs) | Evaluator | DRT | Diff test evaluator on ABAC policies |
| [`formatter`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/formatter.rs) | Policy formatter, Pretty printer, Parser | PBT | Test round trip property: parse ∘ format ∘ pretty-print == id for ASTs |
| [`partial-eval`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/partial-eval.rs) | Partial evaluator | PBT | Test that residual policies with unknowns substituted are equivalent to original policies with unknowns replaced |
| [`pp`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/pp.rs) | Pretty printer, Parser | PBT | Test round trip property: parse ∘ pretty-print == id for ASTs |
| [`rbac-authorizer`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/rbac-authorizer.rs) | Authorizer | PBT + DRT | Test for correct authorization responses over a set of simple policies |
| [`rbac`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/rbac.rs) | Authorizer | DRT | Diff test authorizer on sets of RBAC policies, including template instantiations |
| [`simple-parser`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/simple-parser.rs) |  Parser | DRT | Test that parsing doesn't crash with random input strings |
| [`strict-validation-drt-type-directed`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/strict-validation-drt-type-directed.rs) | Validator | DRT | Diff test strict validation using (mostly) well-typed inputs |
| [`validation-drt-type-directed`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/validation-drt-type-directed.rs) | Validator | DRT | Diff test permissive validation using (mostly) well-typed inputs |
| [`validation-drt`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/validation-drt.rs) | Validator | DRT | Diff test permissive validation |
| [`validation-pbt`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/validation-pbt.rs) | Validator | PBT | Test that validated policies do not result in type errors |
| [`wildcard-matching`](fuzz/fuzz_targets/wildcard-matching.rs) | String matching algorithm used for the `like` operator | DRT | Diff test wildcard matching using a regex-based implementation |
